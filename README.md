Testing practice from The Odin Project using Jest

## why TDD?

**Test Driven Development:** This is a development process that emphasizes the creation of tests in base to the requirements before any code is written, this allow us to track our code base on this series of unit test cases reducing the need for debugging later as we catch errors as early as possible. This Agile methodology leads to more reliable, maintainable, and well-documented code.
